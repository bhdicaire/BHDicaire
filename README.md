### Hello 👋

I'm working at the intersection of security, and technology. I share projects on Github since 2012, you can find more context for many of the repositories hosted here on my [personal blog](https://BHDicaire.com/en/). You can also browse all the projects I've found interesting by looking at what I've [starred](https://github.com/BHDicaire?tab=stars). 

I'm active on 💼 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhdicaire) and currently learning: [AWS Style Dictionnary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary).
